//! ringcrypt-ntt — the number-theoretic transform core.
//!
//! The dominant cost of every RLWE-style homomorphic encryption scheme
//! (CKKS / BFV / BGV) is polynomial multiplication in the ring
//! `R = Z_q[x]/(x^N + 1)`. That product is computed with the **NTT** —
//! the finite-field analogue of the FFT — in O(N log N) instead of O(N²).
//!
//! This crate provides:
//!
//! - [`arith`]: modular arithmetic, including 32-bit-word emulation of
//!   64-bit modular multiplication (the "no native 64-bit on GPU" trick),
//!   all validated against a big-integer reference.
//! - [`ntt`]: iterative in-place cyclic NTT / INTT over `Z_q` (order-`N`
//!   root of unity).
//! - [`negacyclic`]: RLWE-relevant multiplication mod `x^N + 1` built on a
//!   size-`2N` cyclic NTT (the embedding trick), validated against
//!   schoolbook multiplication.
//! - [`params`]: the NTT-friendly prime and root-of-unity tables used by
//!   the demos and regression suite.
//!
//! ## Correctness contract
//!
//! Everything is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Every kernel is cross-checked
//! against a slow, obviously-correct reference in the test-suite and in the
//! [`self_test`] entry point so the browser demo can prove it *in place*.
